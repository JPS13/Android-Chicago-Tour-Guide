# Android-Chicago-Tour-Guide

  This project was created as part of the Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree. It uses multiple screens to display lists of various locations of interest in Chicago. The user can choose a category by clicking on it and navigate to that Activity to view a list of locations associated with that category.
